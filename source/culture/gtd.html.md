# GTD - Getting Things Done

GTD is the work-life management system that has helped countless individuals and organizations bring order to chaos. GTD enables greater performance, capacity, and innovation. It alleviates the feeling of overwhelm—instilling focus, clarity, and confidence.

The appeal of GTD lies in its simplicity. At its core are three principles.

1. **Don’t keep “stuff” in your head.** Capture it so you don’t lose that great idea and you’re not fretting about forgetting a task. Writing it down frees your brain from trying to retain everything, so you can do actual creative problem solving.

2. **List your next action.** Transform the “stuff” you capture into concrete outcomes and next steps. This allows you to break down even very large projects into smaller, doable steps. And this keeps you from being overwhelmed by fluffy, undefined “stuff".

3. **Trust your system** to maintain the remaining steps for you — and every other idea you’ve captured.
