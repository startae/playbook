# Oh no!

Once upon a time, Rafael and Victoria were starting a new project. They were supposed to redesign the experience for a coaching platform and were watching screencasts to better understand how the system worked. As the lady explained how to add and edit participants she did not notice that the edit button was right next to the delete trash bin. She then accidentally clicked the delete icon and, since there was no alert, deleted a real participant from the platform. Losing her composure and yelling "OOOOH NO!!!"

# Beautiful

Don't ever say this word at the office. NEVER EVER.

You probably want to say it, don't you? You have probably already have said it, didn't you?

And you have probably heard someone singing ["Beautiful"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FE194VN6c4) in a highly pitched voice. We actually don't know how this started, but that will happen EVERY TIME you say that word.

# _Only the gold_ or _SÃ³ u ouro_

If you find yourself asking: "what the hell _only the gold_ means?". Calm down. It's easy to catch.
For most cultures, the gold color is a good thing. It's related to success, achievement and triumph.

Gold in its physical state, by its very nature, denotes wealth and prestige in every country, culture and market in the world today - it is probably the most valuable and easily traded commodity available in the global marketplace.

So, if you ask someone at the office: "_Hey, how're you?_" and this person answer "_only the gold_", it means that
this person is in well-being  state.
