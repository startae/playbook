# Styleguide

The key word here is **consistency**. By having a pattern to follow, we can maintain our code clean, improve team communication, and also make things easier for newcomers.

Airbnb has put together a great set of rules and best-practices for Javascript, which we can easily use in our code with eslint.

There is also a few guidelines for CSS/SASS:

We also have an open repo *(WIP)* for Startaê’s style guides:
