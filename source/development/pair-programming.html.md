# Pair Programming

Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work as a pair together on one workstation. It is counter intuitive, but 2 people working at a single computer will add as much functionality as two working separately except that it will be much higher in quality.

This technique also helps with knowledge sharing inside the team. When a developer is unfamiliar with a given technology and is pairing with one who knows it well, the learning process will be faster. Itâ€™s also a great way to avoid distractions and keep the team focused.

Our process is very easy to do:

- Start with a reasonably well-defined task
- Only one is typing at a time (the driver).
- Switch roles often -- at least every half hour
