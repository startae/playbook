# Guidelines

#### Be concise
- Use as few words as possible. Avoid unnecessary and redundant information.
- Avoid large blocks of text.
- Avoid long, complex sentences.

#### Be conversational
- Use natural, conversational language, no bullshit.
- Contractions are okay to be used. "Here's a list of projects we’ve released & contributed to." Instead of "Here is a list of projects we have released & contributed to". They make the text more human
- Avoid developer/designer-focused terminology, unless you’re writing for them.

#### Be direct
- Use active voice "The boy hit the ball" not "The ball was hit by the boy".
- Avoid complex verb structures.

#### Be Positive
-  Remember, we empower positive change.
- Always try to write sentences positively, not negatively.
