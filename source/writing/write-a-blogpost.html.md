Do you want to share your ideas and last discovers on our blog? You're warmly welcome! You just have to follow these steps:

* Create a new task in our [project](https://app.getflow.com/teams/91453/workspaces/216882/lists/912557)
* Create a Google Docs for your article and share the link in the task when it's ready for review (remember to move to the _Ready For Review_ column)
* You can follow [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17pvoPgVBmrfVltyMDSN6UztiS_zBXpqbFitaCnzA0fg/edit) we created to make the process easier
* You can use tools such [Grammarly](http://grammarly.com) in order to check if everything is ok
* Post on the **#presenca-digital** channel that you're done in order to get at least **3** reviewers for the article
* Subscribe the reviewers in the task
