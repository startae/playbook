# Writing

Like Design, text is more than a sum of its words.

Just like good UX/UI/Code, a good text considers the brand and the user. To engage our customers, we need to talk in a way that connects with them.

When you are writing for Startaê, you are carrying forward your voice and representing Startaê at the same time. We take writing to heart; that's why it's important to us that care about every little detail of your copy.

Remember that: "Consistency is the key to building and maintaining a strong, trusted brand, which is why adhering to our voice, tone, and style guidelines is so important." - Couldn't write it better than Mailchimp did.

In order to achieve those goals, we make sure our content is:

#### Human
Before you start writing, ask yourself: What purpose does this serve? Who is going to read it? What do they already know and what don't they know?

#### Simple
"Simple writing is persuasive. A good argument in five sentences will sway more people than a brilliant argument in a hundred sentences. Don’t fight it." Get rid of words that don't add any meaning and always try to use simple words and sentences.

#### Creative
What are the dots you are connecting? What is the perspective you are bringing to the table? And don’t be afraid to break a few rules if it makes your writing more relatable.

#### Delightful
What do you want the reader to feel at when reading that content?
