# Guiding Questions

Here are some questions to consider when you're writing:

#### About the user
- Who is reading this?
- What background knowledge do they have?
- What are their goals?
- What are their pain points?

#### About the context
- Where are they physically?
- What device are they using?
- Are they in a rush?
- Have they been to this page/screen before? How Often?

#### About the goals
Ideally, what we would like them to do after reading?

#### About the brand
How do we want the overall experience to feel?
