# Basic how-to

If you don't read anything else just read this:

- When you are writing here you are representing StartaÃª. You are speaking for yourself and for it
- Think problem are you solving to who is reading and how are you solving it
- Even if you cannot solve their problem try to help somehow (: - positive change
- You are a human writing for other humans
- Be simple. simple words. simple sentences.
- Being fun and relatable is more important than being formal
- Always try to be positive (:
- Make sure at least one more person reviews your text
