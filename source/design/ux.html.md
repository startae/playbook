# Intro

Our product design process is based on the user centered design concept along with some steps that gives us insights that will guide us through the interaction between the user and the product.

We divide the product cycle in steps which don't have to be ordered in a sequence or follow a linear conception. Each step help us to be sure we are improving/solving the main points of the product's demands to design an excellent product.

# Discover

We start doing an initial immersion which make us analyze the assumptions and the risks, and help us loading a large quantity of information. In general, these step offer us the problem's overview and a comprehension of user profiles (personas).

# User Interviews

This process gives many insights that help us creating an user flow based on their feedback (like opinions, feelings, tips) and a demographic profile. For an existing product, it is a "must" to map the user activities and identify their behavior.

# Make

With this arsenal of information and data, it's time to start prototyping. Generally a time of interaction between the team members making drawings on the board, designing low-fidelity wireframes and gradually adding new layers of refinement.

At this moment, we define the navigation flows along with its interactions and start building the user journey inside the product. To create high-fidelity wireframes, we come to the Visual Design, applying product branding and aspects of colors, typography, etc...

# Test

The remote user testing helps us validating the design. They are made in real time to get their reactions and behavior through video recordings (with audio). This way we can get their thoughts out loud while they complete specified tasks. The tests follow a structure similar with the user interviews.

# Repeat
Design is never done, the product's evolution is always necessary. All these steps above guide us to deliver the best experience.

The whole process works as a cycle and has to be repeated every time we need to reinforce questions that are still opened or develop new features.
