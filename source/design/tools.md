We use these tools below to support our necessities during the sprints:

- [Invision app](http://www.invisionapp.com/) to create a real-life experience in prototypes
- [Lookback](https://lookback.io/) to record users' interactions and face movements during the tests
- [Zepplin](https://zeplin.io/) to create styleguides and resources
- [Principle](http://principleformac.com/) to create animated and interactive user interface designs
- [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) to design our prototypes
