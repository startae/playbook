# The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method. It was developed on late 80's by Francesco Cirillo, which was looking for a way to increase his productivity on studying.

In practice, it consists in divide your work in blocks of time, called Pomodoro. Each Pomodoro has a 25-minute duration, which you have to work on a single task, without interruptions. At the end of this block, you will have a 5-minute break. Once you have completed four Pomodoros, you can take a longer break. 20 minutes is good. Or 30.
