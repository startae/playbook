# Daily SUPs

We have a quick meeting with the project's team that happens in a daily basis. This meeting is called Stand-up Meeting (a.k.a SUP).

Meetings are quick. Usually, they range from 5 to 15 minutes, and it happens with participants standing to remind them to go straight to the point.

It's a moment to share with the rest of the team which tasks you've worked on, what is the main insights or problems you've encountered and what is the next task you intend to tackle.

This way, the team is always kept in sync about what is happening in the project.
