# How things work here

### The schedule

Each member of the team is responsible for deciding their weekly tasks and when to do them. So no matter what time you start/finish work, what time you come to the office or even if you come to the office. Everyone is aware that their work impacts the result of the team and no matter the time.

### Bermudism

We are adepts of bermudism at Startaê. We believe everyone should be free to work the way they feel more comfortable and that your clothes will not affect your productivity.

We like to keep an informal environment and we think it makes our team more united.

### Daily SUPs

We have a quick meeting with the project's team that happens in a daily basis. This meeting is called Stand-up Meeting (a.k.a SUP).

Meetings are quick. Usually, they range from 5 to 15 minutes, and it happens with participants standing to remind them to go straight to the point.

It's a moment to share with the rest of the team which tasks you've worked on, what is the main insights or problems you've encountered and what is the next task you intend to tackle.

This way, the team is always kept in sync about what is happening in the project.

### Weekly Projects SUPs

Once a week, the entire team attend to the Projects SUP. It is similar to the daily SUP in the sense that all project teams present their progress in the previous week and what they intend to do the next week.

### Friday

Friday is a day dedicated to Startaê. On Fridays, we don't work on our customers' projects. It is a day focused on internal projects, exchange of knowledge and team development.
