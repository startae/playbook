# OKR - Objectives and Key Results

OKR is a framework to define company goals. It is adopted by most of the big players in Silicon Valley, such as Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, Dropbox and Oracle.

In summary, the method consists of defining measurable **key-results** for each of your **objectives**. The objects itself, are more qualitative and are related to what you want to achieve. The key-results, on the other hand, are a way to tell how close (or how far) you are from reaching your objectives, therefore they are more quantitative. It's like a success criteria that will show if you are making progress.
