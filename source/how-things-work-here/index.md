# How things work here

### The schedule

Each member of the team is responsible for deciding their weekly tasks and when to do them. So no matter what time you start/finish work, what time you come to the office or even if you come to the office. Everyone is aware that their work impacts the result of the team and no matter the time.

### Bermudism

We are adept of bermudism at Startaê. We believe everyone should be comfortable to work the way they feel more comfortable and that your clothes will not affect your productivity.

We like to keep an informal environment and we believe that it makes our team more comfortable and united.

### Daily SUPs

We have a quick meeting with the project team that is working every day. This meeting is called Stand-up Meeting (a.k.a SUP).

Meetings are quick. Usually, it has a timebox for 5 to 15 minutes, and it happens with participants standing to remind them to go straight to the point.

It's a moment to share with the rest of the team which tasks you worked on, what is the main insights or problems and what is the next task you intend to do. And all the other team members do the same.

This way, the team always keeps synced about what is happening during the project.

### Weekly Projects SUPs

Once a week, on Monday, the entire team attend to the Projects SUP. It is similar to the daily SUP but that all project teams present their progress in the previous week and what they intend to do that week.

### Friday

Friday is a day dedicated to Startaê team. On Fridays, we don't work on our customers' projects. It is a day  focused on internal projects, exchange of knowledge and team development.
